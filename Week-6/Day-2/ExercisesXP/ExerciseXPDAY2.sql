-- Exercise 1 : Items And Customers
-- Instructions
-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.
-- Use SQL to get the following from the database:

-- All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY price ASC

-- Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).

SELECT * FROM items WHERE price >= 80

-- The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) â€“ exclude the primary key column from the results.
SELECT first_name FROM customers ORDER BY first_name ASC LIMIT 3

-- All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)
	SELECT last_name FROM customers ORDER BY last_name DESC
