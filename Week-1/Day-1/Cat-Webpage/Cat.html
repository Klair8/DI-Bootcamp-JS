<h2>The lions</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, 
but is absent in dense forests.<br> 
It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight.<br> 
A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. <br>
Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. <br>
Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, 
zebra and even giraffe.</p>
